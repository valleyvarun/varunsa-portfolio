I am an aspiring architect with a strong passion for computational design and technology-driven solutions. As a final-year architecture student at the School of Planning and Architecture, Bhopal, I have dedicated my academic journey to exploring the intersection of art, science, and innovation in design.

My experience spans working on diverse projects, including designing spaces for industrial architecture, research facilities, and laboratories, which I honed during my internship at Studio Archnovate. I am also deeply fascinated by artificial intelligence, parametric modeling, and advanced tools like Grasshopper and Python, which have become central to my design approach.
