I am an aspiring architect with a strong enthusiasm for developing digital tools for design, particularly focusing on the synergy between BIM and AI.

I have dedicated my academic journey to exploring the intersection of art, science, and technology. My experience spans working on diverse projects, including designing spaces for industrial architecture, research facilities, and factories. 

My final-year B.Arch research thesis is on architecture for semiconductor electronics FABs, where I explore their functionality, integrating aesthetics, and the Human experience at such facilities.

I hope you like my work :)
